# Bat Detection in Cavity Walls

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system that can **detect bats in cavity walls**.  
Bats frequently use cavity walls as habitats and migration corridors.  
By monitoring their activity, this project contributes both to **bat conservation** and to **building practices** that account for ecological concerns.

## Motivation
- **Ecological**: Support the protection of vulnerable bat species.  
- **Architectural**: Provide better guidelines for renovation and insulation projects while respecting bat habitats.  

## Objectives
### Must-Haves
- Build and deliver functional hardware modules.  
- Document the project in an **Application Note**.  
- Maintain clear project documentation in this repository (README, source code, setup instructions).  
- Conduct code reviews via GitHub.  

### Nice-to-Haves
- Design and produce a custom PCB.  

## System Approach
The detection system combines **thermal imaging, acoustic monitoring, and environmental sensors** to map how bats use cavity walls and to identify influencing factors.

### Key Components
- **ESP32**: microcontroller for data collection and wireless communication.  
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: supporting data acquisition.  
- **IR Camera**: thermal imaging of bat activity.  
- **Audio Recorder**: ultrasonic bat call detection.  
- **Sensors**: temperature, humidity, and pressure monitoring.  
- **Wireless & SD storage**: data backup and redundancy.  

## Development Process
1. Analyze current issues (battery limitations, condensation, wireless reliability).  
2. Work in teams of 2â€“3 students.  
3. Prototype and test sensor modules.  
4. Improve iteratively based on test results and feedback.  

## Deliverables
- Functional hardware modules.  
- Application Note (system design, operation, limitations).  
- GitHub repository including:  
  - Source code  
  - README documentation  
  - Setup instructions  
- Optional: PCB design.
